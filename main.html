    <h1 style="color: rgb(92, 3, 84); font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">My Point of View</h1>
<p style="font-size: large; font-style: inherit; color: olive;">I believe that, we can improve ourselves helping each other. We all need to strive hard to get succes and lets not step back when it comes to hardword because if we give oue all, only then we will be able to expect something we desired. From my 15 yrs experience, I think improvement is what matters teh most. The world too is always improving, even if we think that be are in the best state now, it will not stay the same best after sometimes as the things changes; the world changes, people need to change accordingly. It's not like everyone is perfect, so i think we will be able to show better side of ourselves once we have unity, when we have believe in each other. We get the real happiness from helping others! Being one, being Jugal I believe that we all can suceed in achieving our dreams.</p>
